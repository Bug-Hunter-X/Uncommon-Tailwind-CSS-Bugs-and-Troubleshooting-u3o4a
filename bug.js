```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p class="text-gray-700 text-xl font-bold">This is my component</p>
  <p class="text-gray-600">And this is some content.</p>
</div>
```

This seems fine, but sometimes you might encounter issues like:

- **Unexpected styles:**  The component might not render as expected, with classes seemingly ignored or conflicting.
- **Missing styles:** Certain classes or modifiers fail to apply.
- **Incorrect specificity:** Styles defined later in your CSS might override earlier definitions unexpectedly, even if your class names are correct.
- **Plugin conflicts:** Tailwind plugins may interfere with the core functionality or each other.
